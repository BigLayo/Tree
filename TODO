TODO

- add a Cache-Decorator for the Dynamic_* way so the user can determine if he wants to
  use cached results. i.e. when calling getElement(2) three times, normally it would read
  the data from the DB 3 times, but with a cache it could use cached results.
  of course not cached permanently only for the current script life time
- about Cache, add a per "transaction" cache. That means, when the users call a complex
  method (getIdByPath), cache the result during the read "transaction", lock?

  Move to another architecture, talk to Mike and Lorenzo about joining in.

- Remove nodes recrusivly always.
- Do not require the whole setup process after add/edit/remove/move/copy in memory
  note sure tho what to do with memory <-> dynamic
- because I removed things like parent, next, previous and such fromt the $data array
  then I must fix _getElementId(removed) to cope with that and every other function related to this
- Find a better way to deal with getParent and such when there is no result
- remove buildStructure and add the level code to were I make the structure now and unset parent_id also in the data array
- Add Transactions
- New storage container approach
- setData in all containers
- Fully implement Array container
- Fix structure thing, walk is having some issue, doesn't give errors anymore but there are issues
- Fix getChildren
- Enhance getAllChildren[ids]
- Implement levels to getChildren
- Reimplement get*Id and remove get* and have only one getNode or getData or what ever

Profile this whole thing with APD when I get it to work or xdebug
