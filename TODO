TODO

- add a Cache-Decorator for the Dynamic_* way so the user can determine if he wants to
  use cached results. i.e. when calling getElement(2) three times, normally it would read
  the data from the DB 3 times, but with a cache it could use cached results.
  of course not cached permanently only for the current script life time
- about Cache, add a per "transaction" cache. That means, when the users call a complex 
  method (getIdByPath), cache the result during the read "transaction", lock?
- setOption('columnNameMaps') doesnt work i.e. here
    $tree->setOption('columnNameMaps',array('myComment'=>'comment'));
    $tree->setOption('columnNameMaps',array('comment'=>'comment'));
  because we dont have the column name as the array key, so we cant overwrite it :-(
  this is really stupid
